# Car_Price_Predictor
Frontend (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap):
- Collects user inputs such as car make, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven.
- Displays the predicted car price.
Flask Backend:
- Routes user input from the form to the machine learning model.
- Processes the input and generates a price prediction.
- Sends the predicted price back to the frontend to be displayed to the user.
Machine Learning Model (Python):
- Linear Regression: Provides a simple and interpretable relationship between features and car price.
- The model is trained using historical data of used cars and their selling prices.
- Takes the input features and predicts the car's price.
